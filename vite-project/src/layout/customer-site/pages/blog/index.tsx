                To kick off the day, NRF hosted a press conference on Capitol
                Hill with original congressional sponsors of CORCA. Twenty media
                outlets including CNBC covered the press conference, which also
                featured Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, Sen. Catherine Cortez
                Masto, D-Nev., Rep. David Joyce, R-Ohio, Rep. Dina Titus,
                D-Nev., Rep. Susie Lee, D-Nev., Rep. Glenn Ivey, D-Md., and Rep.
                Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz. A recording of the press conference is
                available on NRF’s Instagram account. Organized retail crime
                Read NRF's latest articles and press releases on organized
                retail crime in the retail industry. Fight Retail Crime Day also
                caught the attention of more than 30 members of Congress who
                showed their support on social media. “On Fight Retail Crime
                Day, we are reminded of the need to protect retailers, customers
                & communities from retail crime,” Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La.,
                shared in a social media post. Rep. Steven Horsford, D-Nev.,
                added his support, saying, “With $100B+ lost in just one year &
                escalating violence, we need federal action & partnerships
                between retailers & law enforcement.” Georgia Attorney General
                Chris Carr also recognized Fight Retail Crime Day with a post on
                X: “Organized retail crime is on the rise, & the impact to
                Georgia & its citizens is significant & weighs heavy on our
                economy. On Fight Retail Crime Day, we’re proud to highlight our
                continued commitment to dismantling these violent networks once
                & for all.”

                One of the most critical factors in choosing a PC is budget. PCs
                come in a wide range of prices, making them accessible to a
                broad spectrum of consumers and businesses. While high-end
                gaming or workstation PCs can be expensive, budget-friendly
                options provide exemplary performance for everyday tasks. The
                availability of Arm-based Windows devices has also contributed
                to a broader price range, with some Arm laptops being more
                affordable than their traditional x86 counterparts.
